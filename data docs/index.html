    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains documentation for the New York Times Corpus, Linguistic 
  Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2008T19 and isbn 1-58563-486-5. 
<p>The New York Times Corpus contains over 1.8 million articles written and published 
  by the New York Times between January 1, 1987 and June 19, 2007 with article 
  metadata provided by the New York Times Newsroom, the New York Times Indexing 
  Service and the online production staff at nytimes.com and associated tools. 
  The corpus includes: 
<ul>
  <li> Over 1.8 million articles (excluding wire services articles that appeared 
    during the covered period).</li>
  <li>Over 650,000 manually written article summaries.</li>
  <li>Over 1,500,000 articles manually tagged by library scientists with tags 
    drawn from a normalized indexing vocabulary of people, organizations, locations 
    and topic descriptors.</li>
  <li>Over 275,000 algorithmically-tagged articles that have been hand verified 
    by the online production staff at nytimes.com. </li>
  <li>Java tools for parsing corpus documents from .xml into a memory resident 
    object.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the New York Times' indexing procedures, most articles are manually 
  summarized and tagged by a staff of library scientists. This collection contains 
  over 650,000 article-summary pairs which may prove to be useful in the development 
  and evaluation of algorithms for automated document summarization. Also, over 
  1.5 million documents have at least one tag. Articles are tagged for persons, 
  places, organizations, titles and topics using a controlled vocabulary that 
  is applied consistently across articles. For instance if one article mentions 
  &quot;Bill Clinton&quot; and another refers to &quot;President William Jefferson 
  Clinton&quot;, both articles will be tagged with &quot;CLINTON, BILL&quot;.

  and corpus statistics, see the <a href="docs/nyt_corpus_overview.pdf" STYLE="text-decoration:none">Corpus Overview</a> included in this release.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>

    
<p>The text in this corpus is formatted in <a href="http://www.nitf.org">News 
  Industry Text Format (NITF)</a> developed by the International Press Telecommunications 
  Council, an independent association of news agencies and publishers. NITF is 
  an XML specification that provides a standardized representation for the content 
  and structure of discrete news articles. NITF encompasses structural markup 
  such as bylines, headlines and paragraphs. The format also provides management 
  attributes for categorizing articles into topics, summarization usage restrictions 
  and revision histories. The goals of NITF are to answer the essential questions 
  inherent in news articles: Who, What, When, Where and Why. 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Who: </strong>Who owns the copyright, who has rights to republish 
    the article and who the article is about.</li>
  <li><strong>What: </strong>The subjects reported, the named entities inside 
    the article and the events it describes.</li>
  <li><strong>When: </strong>When the article was written, when it was issued 
    and when it was revised.</li>
  <li><strong>Where: </strong>Where the article was written, where the events 
    took place and where it was delivered.</li>
  <li><strong>Why: </strong>The metadata describing the newsworthiness of the 
    article. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>This relase includes software written in the Java programming language for 
  parsing corpus documents from xml into a memory resident object. The tools can 
  be found in the 'tools/' directory, which is arranged as follows:</p>
<p><a href="tools/src">tools/src</a><br>
  The source code for the tools.</p>
<p><a href="tools/build/timestools.jar">tools/build/timestools.jar</a><br>
  A jarfile containing the compiled tools.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="tools/docs">tools/docs/</a><br>
  Javadocs for the tools classes.</p>
<p>To build the tools from source, apache ant must be installed (<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a>). 
  Once ant is installed, change into the 'tools' directory and issue the command 
  'ant'. This will create a file 'timestools.jar' in the 'tools/build/' directory.
